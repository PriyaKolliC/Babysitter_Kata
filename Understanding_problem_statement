a)	Objective: Get the amount paid for a babysitter for one night

b)	Key constraints:
 
		1. Start time >= 5.00 pm
		2. End time <= 4.00 am

c)	Pay classification:
		
		1. Start time - bed time --> $12 / hr
		2. Bed time - midnight   --> $8  / hr
		3. Mid night - end time  --> $16 / hr
		
		** only gets paid for full hours, not fractional hours
	
		
		
		start time ( >= 5 pm)
			| 12$
		bed time
			| 8$
		midnight time
			| 16$
		end time ( <= 4 am)
		
	
d)  Midnight time - 12 am
	
	
e)	Key Conclusions:
		1. Start time should be after 5 pm and before end time
		2. End time should be after start time and before 4 am
		3. Bed time should lie in between start time and end time(inclusive)
		4. If bed time is after mid night time, then no bed time hours are considered
		5. Rescaling times 5 pm - 4 am to a new scale of values 17(5 pm) - 28(4 am) for 
		   simplifying the problem.
